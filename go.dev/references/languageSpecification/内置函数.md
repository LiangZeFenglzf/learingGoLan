Notation
The syntax is specified using Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF):

Production  = production_name "=" [ Expression ] "." .
Expression  = Alternative { "|" Alternative } .
Alternative = Term { Term } .
Term        = production_name | token [ "…" token ] | Group | Option | Repetition .
Group       = "(" Expression ")" .
Option      = "[" Expression "]" .
Repetition  = "{" Expression "}" .
Productions are expressions constructed from terms and the following operators, in increasing precedence: 有以下运算符和item构造而来

|   alternation  替换
()  grouping     归为一组
[]  option (0 or 1 times)   可选   
{}  repetition (0 to n times)  重复
Lower-case production names are used to identify lexical tokens. Non-terminals are in CamelCase. Lexical tokens are enclosed in double quotes "" or back quotes ``.

The form a … b represents the set of characters from a through b as alternatives. The horizontal ellipsis … is also used elsewhere in the spec to informally denote various enumerations or code snippets that are not further specified. The character … (as opposed to the three characters ...) is not a token of the Go language.

## Built-in functions

Built-in functions are [predeclared](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Predeclared_identifiers). They are called like any other function but some of them accept a type instead of an expression as the first argument.

The built-in functions do not have standard Go types, so they can only appear in [call expressions](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Calls); they cannot be used as function values.

### Close

For a channel `c`, the built-in function `close(c)` records that no more values will be sent on the channel.

不再会有 信息传输

 It is an error if `c` is a receive-only channel. 

如果管道类型是只接受型.....

Sending to or closing a closed channel causes a [run-time panic](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Run_time_panics).

发送或关闭一个已经关闭的管道会...

 Closing the nil channel also causes a [run-time panic](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Run_time_panics). 

关闭空管道也会...

After calling `close`, and after any previously sent values have been received, receive operations will return the zero value for the channel's type without blocking. The multi-valued [receive operation](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Receive_operator) returns a received value along with an indication of whether the channel is closed.

### Length and capacity

The built-in functions `len` and `cap` take arguments of various types and return a result of type `int`. 

需要承载 多中类型的变量 返回int值

The implementation guarantees that the result always fits into an `int`.

```
Call      Argument type    Result

len(s)    string type      string length in bytes   字符串的字节长度而不是符号个数，所以s[i]也是取字符串的第几个字节，而不是字符
          [n]T, *[n]T      array length (== n)  
          []T              slice length 
          map[K]T          map length (number of defined keys) 字典的Key的个数
          chan T           number of elements queued in channel buffer 在管道buffer排队的元素个数

cap(s)    [n]T, *[n]T      array length (== n)  
          []T              slice capacity   切片容量，这里需要注意之前以为切片容量是底层数组的长度
          chan T           channel buffer capacity 
```

The capacity of a slice is the number of elements for which there is space allocated in the underlying array. At any time the following relationship holds:

```
0 <= len(s) <= cap(s)
```

The length of a `nil` slice, map or channel is 0. The capacity of a `nil` slice or channel is 0.

**空切片的容量0 而不是我以为的底层数组length** 

[^]: 空切片没有引用底层数组，切片的构成以及切片容量的定义可知 空切片容量是0

The expression `len(s)` is [constant](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Constants) if `s` is a string constant. 

 The expressions `len(s)` and `cap(s)` are constants if the type of `s` is an array or pointer to an array 【数组类型或者是数组指针】and the expression `s` does not contain [channel receives](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Receive_operator) or (non-constant) [function calls](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Calls);表达式s 不包含   通道接收和 函数调用

 in this case `s` is not evaluated. 

**evaluated  v求（方程式，公式，函数）的数值**

Otherwise, invocations【**（计算机）调用，启用；**】 of `len` and `cap` are not constant and `s` is evaluated.

```
const (
	c1 = imag(2i)                    // imag(2i) = 2.0 is a constant
	c2 = len([10]float64{2})         // [10]float64{2} contains no function calls
	c3 = len([10]float64{c1})        // [10]float64{c1} contains no function calls
	c4 = len([10]float64{imag(2i)})  // imag(2i) is a constant and no function call is issued
	c5 = len([10]float64{imag(z)})   // invalid: imag(z) is a (non-constant) function call
)
var z complex128
```

### Allocation

The built-in function `new` takes a type `T`, allocates storage for a [variable](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Variables) of that type at run time, and **returns a value of type `*T` [pointing](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Pointer_types) to it.** The variable is initialized as described in the section on [initial values](https://go.dev/ref/spec#The_zero_value).

```
new(T)
```

For instance

```
type S struct { a int; b float64 }
new(S)
```

allocates storage for a variable of type `S`, initializes it (`a=0`, `b=0.0`), and returns a value of type `*S` containing the address of the location.

#### New 和Make区别

new一个引用类型 ，Make一个引用类型的区别是 nil 和 0值的区别.

new,make一个简单数据类型或者结构体 都是会赋值 初始值 没区别。参考effecitve-go

由于 new返回指针  对引用类型初始化肯定是Nil 但如果new普通数据结构类型 指针？？返回0 ""  疑点在于有哪些数据类型可以有指针。

| New                                                          | Make                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| *T                                                           | T                               |
| a value of type `*T` [pointing](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Pointer_types) to it | a value of type `T` (not `*T`). |

### Making slices, maps and channels

The built-in function `make` takes a type `T`, which must be a slice, map or channel type, optionally followed by a type-specific list of expressions. **It returns a value of type `T` (not `*T`).** The memory is initialized as described in the section on [initial values](https://go.dev/ref/spec#The_zero_value).

```
Call             Type T     Result

make(T, n)       slice      slice of type T with length n and capacity n
make(T, n, m)    slice      slice of type T with length n and capacity m

make(T)          map        map of type T
make(T, n)       map        map of type T with initial space for approximately n elements

make(T)          channel    unbuffered channel of type T
make(T, n)       channel    buffered channel of type T, buffer size n
```

Each of the size arguments `n` and `m` must be of integer type or an untyped [constant](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Constants). A constant size argument must be non-negative and [representable](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Representability) by a value of type `int`; if it is an untyped constant it is given type `int`. If both `n` and `m` are provided and are constant, then `n` must be no larger than `m`. If `n` is negative or larger than `m` at run time, a [run-time panic](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Run_time_panics) occurs.

```
s := make([]int, 10, 100)       // slice with len(s) == 10, cap(s) == 100
s := make([]int, 1e3)           // slice with len(s) == cap(s) == 1000
s := make([]int, 1<<63)         // illegal: len(s) is not representable by a value of type int
s := make([]int, 10, 0)         // illegal: len(s) > cap(s)
c := make(chan int, 10)         // channel with a buffer size of 10
m := make(map[string]int, 100)  // map with initial space for approximately 100 elements
```

Calling `make` with a map type and size hint `n` will create a map with initial space to hold `n` map elements. The precise behavior is implementation-dependent.

### Appending to and copying slices

The built-in functions `append` and `copy` assist in common slice operations. For both functions, the result is independent of whether the memory referenced by the arguments overlaps.

The [variadic](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Function_types) function `append` appends zero or more values `x` to `s` of type `S`, which must be a slice type, and returns the resulting slice, also of type `S`. The values `x` are passed to a parameter of type `...T` where `T` is the [element type](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Slice_types) of `S` and the respective [parameter passing rules](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Passing_arguments_to_..._parameters) apply. As a special case, `append` also accepts a first argument assignable to type `[]byte` with a second argument of string type followed by `...`. This form appends the bytes of the string.

```
append(s S, x ...T) S  // T is the element type of S
```

If the capacity of `s` is not large enough to fit the additional values, `append` allocates a new, sufficiently large underlying array that fits both the existing slice elements and the additional values. Otherwise, `append` re-uses the underlying array.

```
s0 := []int{0, 0}
s1 := append(s0, 2)                // append a single element     s1 == []int{0, 0, 2}
s2 := append(s1, 3, 5, 7)          // append multiple elements    s2 == []int{0, 0, 2, 3, 5, 7}
s3 := append(s2, s0...)            // append a slice              s3 == []int{0, 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 0, 0}
s4 := append(s3[3:6], s3[2:]...)   // append overlapping slice    s4 == []int{3, 5, 7, 2, 3, 5, 7, 0, 0}

var t []interface{}
t = append(t, 42, 3.1415, "foo")   //                             t == []interface{}{42, 3.1415, "foo"}

var b []byte
b = append(b, "bar"...)            // append string contents      b == []byte{'b', 'a', 'r' }
```

The function `copy` copies slice elements from a source `src` to a destination `dst` and returns the number of elements copied. Both arguments must have [identical](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Type_identity) element type `T` and must be [assignable](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Assignability) to a slice of type `[]T`. The number of elements copied is the minimum of `len(src)` and `len(dst)`. As a special case, `copy` also accepts a destination argument assignable to type `[]byte` with a source argument of a string type. This form copies the bytes from the string into the byte slice.

```
copy(dst, src []T) int
copy(dst []byte, src string) int
```

Examples:

```
var a = [...]int{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
var s = make([]int, 6)
var b = make([]byte, 5)
n1 := copy(s, a[0:])            // n1 == 6, s == []int{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
n2 := copy(s, s[2:])            // n2 == 4, s == []int{2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 5}
n3 := copy(b, "Hello, World!")  // n3 == 5, b == []byte("Hello")
```

### Deletion of map elements 切片是不需要删除功能的

The built-in function `delete` removes the element with key `k` from a [map](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Map_types) `m`. The type of `k` must be [assignable](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Assignability) to the key type of `m`.

```
delete(m, k)  // remove element m[k] from map m
```

If the map `m` is `nil` or the element `m[k]` does not exist, `delete` is a no-op.

### Manipulating complex numbers

Three functions assemble and disassemble complex numbers. The built-in function `complex` constructs a complex value from a floating-point real and imaginary part, while `real` and `imag` extract the real and imaginary parts of a complex value.

```
complex(realPart, imaginaryPart floatT) complexT
real(complexT) floatT
imag(complexT) floatT
```

The type of the arguments and return value correspond. For `complex`, the two arguments must be of the same floating-point type and the return type is the complex type with the corresponding floating-point constituents: `complex64` for `float32` arguments, and `complex128` for `float64` arguments. If one of the arguments evaluates to an untyped constant, it is first implicitly [converted](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Conversions) to the type of the other argument. If both arguments evaluate to untyped constants, they must be non-complex numbers or their imaginary parts must be zero, and the return value of the function is an untyped complex constant.

For `real` and `imag`, the argument must be of complex type, and the return type is the corresponding floating-point type: `float32` for a `complex64` argument, and `float64` for a `complex128` argument. If the argument evaluates to an untyped constant, it must be a number, and the return value of the function is an untyped floating-point constant.

The `real` and `imag` functions together form the inverse of `complex`, so for a value `z` of a complex type `Z`, `z == Z(complex(real(z), imag(z)))`.

If the operands of these functions are all constants, the return value is a constant.

```
var a = complex(2, -2)             // complex128
const b = complex(1.0, -1.4)       // untyped complex constant 1 - 1.4i
x := float32(math.Cos(math.Pi/2))  // float32
var c64 = complex(5, -x)           // complex64
var s int = complex(1, 0)          // untyped complex constant 1 + 0i can be converted to int
_ = complex(1, 2<<s)               // illegal: 2 assumes floating-point type, cannot shift
var rl = real(c64)                 // float32
var im = imag(a)                   // float64
const c = imag(b)                  // untyped constant -1.4
_ = imag(3 << s)                   // illegal: 3 assumes complex type, cannot shift
```

### Handling panics

Two built-in functions, `panic` and `recover`, assist in reporting and handling [run-time panics](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Run_time_panics) and program-defined error conditions.

```
func panic(interface{})
func recover() interface{}
```

While executing a function `F`, an explicit call to `panic` or a [run-time panic](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Run_time_panics) terminates the execution of `F`. Any functions [deferred](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Defer_statements) by `F` are then executed as usual. Next, any deferred functions run by `F's` caller are run, and so on up to any deferred by the top-level function in the executing goroutine. At that point, the program is terminated and the error condition is reported, including the value of the argument to `panic`. This termination sequence is called *panicking*.

```
panic(42)
panic("unreachable")
panic(Error("cannot parse"))
```

The `recover` function allows a program to manage behavior of a panicking goroutine. Suppose a function `G` defers a function `D` that calls `recover` and a panic occurs in a function on the same goroutine in which `G` is executing. When the running of deferred functions reaches `D`, the return value of `D`'s call to `recover` will be the value passed to the call of `panic`. If `D` returns normally, without starting a new `panic`, the panicking sequence stops. In that case, the state of functions called between `G` and the call to `panic` is discarded, and normal execution resumes. Any functions deferred by `G` before `D` are then run and `G`'s execution terminates by returning to its caller.

The return value of `recover` is `nil` if any of the following conditions holds:

- `panic`'s argument was `nil`;
- the goroutine is not panicking;
- `recover` was not called directly by a deferred function.

The `protect` function in the example below invokes the function argument `g` and protects callers from run-time panics raised by `g`.

```
func protect(g func()) {
	defer func() {
		log.Println("done")  // Println executes normally even if there is a panic
		if x := recover(); x != nil {
			log.Printf("run time panic: %v", x)
		}
	}()
	log.Println("start")
	g()
}
```

### Bootstrapping

Current implementations provide several built-in functions useful during bootstrapping. These functions are documented for completeness but are not guaranteed to stay in the language. They do not return a result.

```
Function   Behavior

print      prints all arguments; formatting of arguments is implementation-specific
println    like print but prints spaces between arguments and a newline at the end
```

Implementation restriction: `print` and `println` need not accept arbitrary argument types, but printing of boolean, numeric, and string [types](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Types) must be supported.
